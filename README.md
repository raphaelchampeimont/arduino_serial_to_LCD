# arduino_serial_to_LCD
The Arduino code in the "serial_to_LCD" folder reads data from the Arduino serial port and displays it on the LCD screen (HD44780 compatible). It works both with the virtual serial port through the USB cable and a direct connection to the RX pin.

How to connect the LCD screen:

# Variant 1: Virtual serial port with USB
The simplest way to send serial data to the Arduino is to use the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE and the USB cable.

# Variant 2: Real serial port (RS232) with custom adapter circuit
## Computer TX to Arduino RX
For the challenge, I wanted to send data from my computer's real serial port (RS232 9-pin connector). For that, I created an adaptor circuit because the voltages on a computer serial port are different from what the Arduino expects. Don't connect the computer TX pin to the Arduino RX pin directly, it would fry your Arduino according to the documentation (https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/). 

You can watch my YouTube video where I show the circuit working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Crk8dcw9A

This adaptor circuit translates -12V (logical 1 in RS232) to 5V and +12V (logical 0) to 0V.

I have represented the Arduino RX pin as a diode and resistor just to think about the circuit, but the actual hardware inside is probably different.

## Arduino TX to computer RX
Altough it is not used by this program, I also created the circuit to perform serial communication in the reverse direction, ie. from Arduino TX pin to computer RS232 RX pin.

This adaptor circuit translates 0V to 5V (understood as logical 0 in RS232) and 5V to -9V (understood as logical 1 in RS232).

I have represented the Arduino TX pin as a switch to +5V/GND just to think about the circuit, but the actual hardware inside is probably different.

(The GND of the RS232 port is connected to the Arduino GND off camera)

# Variant 3: Real serial port (RS232) with a MAX232 IC
MAX232 is an IC which allows to convert from/to Arduino RX/TX to a computer serial port (RS232). With this circuit, you don't need a 9V battery like with my homemade circuit above. Here is the setup with a MAX232A. All capacitors are 0.1 ÂµF here, as required by the MAX232A data sheet. If you have another MAX232 variant, the capcitors values might be different, check it in the data sheet.
